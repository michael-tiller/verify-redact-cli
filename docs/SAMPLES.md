# Samples

The samples directory contains synthetic test PDFs used to validate redact-verify.

All documents contain fictional data.
PASS/FAIL expectations are documented in the root (README.md).
Some files intentionally PASS despite appearing deceptive, because they contain no recoverable semantic text.
